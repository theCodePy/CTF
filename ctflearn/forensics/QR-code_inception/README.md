# QR-code inception

 70 points Hard

My boss read in a magazine that people in China are using QR-codes to pay goods. He thinks it is the future and he wants QR-codes everywhere from the company website to his coffee machine. To meet my new boss requirements, he asked me to write an application generating QR-code. I spent days on it as scope always changes.

Thanks god, the week-end is there and I can forget about these QR-codes. Yesterday, I watched "Inception" by Christopher Nolan, it was great but the night after did not turn well and I got strange dreams.

I am sharing with you a picture I took during my dream (yes I can because I am a hacker). Welcome to my QR-code inception...
