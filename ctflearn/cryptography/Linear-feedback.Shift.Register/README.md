Hello!

I have just implemented a super-cool PRNG!

I've used every next generated by it number to XOR every next character in my super-secret message with.

Are you able to retrieve it?

Btw. Biggest possibly generated number by my PRNG is 255.

Psst. The retrieved message would be your flag!

As always, starting with: CTFlearn{...

I'm giving you the PRNG scheme with a brief description (description.png) and a "secretMessage.hex" file with every byte being the corresponding message char inside PRNG.zip file.
